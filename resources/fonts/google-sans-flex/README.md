The variable font contains weight, width, optical-size, slant, grade, and
roundness axes. Flectar currently selects the standard family design and uses
the existing UI `font-weight` values. Slint and cosmic-text continue to use
platform fonts when a required glyph is unavailable in this family.

Received email HTML is intentionally excluded. Its typography remains
sender-controlled, with the renderer's independent email fallback stack.
